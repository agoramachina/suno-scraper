🎵 Suno Scraper Project - Handover Document
Project Summary
Building a tool to bulk download all songs from a user's Suno AI library with complete metadata (title, prompt, tags, creation date, etc.). Created two versions: a Chrome Extension (recommended) and a Node.js script.

Current Status: ✅ CODE COMPLETE - NEEDS GIT PUSH
All 12 files have been created and shared with the user. The user now has all the code. The only remaining task is pushing to GitHub.

Repository Information
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/agoramachina/suno-scraper
Repo Status: Public, empty (user just created it)
Branch: Should push to main

What Each Component Does
1. Node.js Script (suno-downloader.js)

Standalone CLI tool
Requires manual token/device-id from browser DevTools
Downloads songs, metadata, and cover images
Organizes by project folders
2. Chrome Extension (suno-extension/)

Better UX - automatic authentication, no token copying
Visual progress tracking
Extracts auth tokens automatically via content.js
Downloads managed by background.js
UI in popup.html/js/css
Icon generator included (create-icons.html)
Technical Details
Suno API Endpoints Used
1. Get all songs (paginated):

GET https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/feed/v2?hide_disliked=true&hide_gen_stems=true&hide_studio_clips=true&page=0
2. Get specific songs by IDs:

GET https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/clips/get_songs_by_ids?ids=xxx&ids=yyy
Authentication Required:

Header: authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Header: device-id: <UUID>
Response Structure (from API)
{
  "clips": [
    {
      "id": "abc123...",
      "title": "Song Title",
      "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/...mp3",
      "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/...jpeg",
      "metadata": {
        "tags": "style description",
        "prompt": "user's original prompt",
        "duration": 214.96

Issues Encountered & Workarounds
Git Push Authorization Failure
Problem: Local git proxy (http://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/git/...) returns:

502 Proxy error: repository not authorized for suno-scraper repo
Works fine for obsidian-ai-tagger-universe repo
Context:

Files were initially created in /home/user/obsidian-ai-tagger-universe/ (wrong repo)
Copied to /home/user/suno-scraper/
Initialized git, committed locally successfully
Push fails due to authorization
What Was Attempted:

Using correct proxy URL format with local_proxy@ prefix
Retrying with exponential backoff (2s, 4s delays)
Waiting for repo to become public
Current State:

All files exist at /home/user/suno-scraper/
Git initialized with main branch
Changes committed locally
Push to GitHub pending (authorization issue)
What the Next Claude Should Do
Option 1: Try Pushing Again (Quick Test)
cd /home/user/suno-scraper
git remote -v  # Verify remote is set correctly
git push -u origin main
If this works, you're done! If not, proceed to Option 2.

Option 2: Have User Push Manually
Tell the user:

"I'm still experiencing git authorization issues with the proxy. Here's what you can do to get the files to GitHub:

Option A: You already have all 12 files from our conversation. Create the folder structure locally and push yourself.

Option B: I can create a single consolidated file with all the code that you can download and extract."

Then create a single mega-file if they want it.

Files Location in This Session
All files physically exist at:

/home/user/suno-scraper/ (ready to push)
Old location (can be ignored):

/home/user/obsidian-ai-tagger-universe/suno-extension/
/home/user/obsidian-ai-tagger-universe/suno-downloader.js
/home/user/obsidian-ai-tagger-universe/SUNO_DOWNLOADER_README.md
Key Features to Highlight
When talking to the user about this project:

Chrome Extension:

✅ No token copying needed (auto-extracts from browser)
✅ Visual progress bar and stats
✅ Saves to Downloads/suno-downloads/
✅ Filters: public/private songs
✅ Project-based folder organization
✅ Icon generator tool included
Node.js Script:

✅ Cross-platform CLI tool
✅ Same features as extension
✅ Requires manual token setup
Both save:

MP3 audio files
High-res cover images (JPG)
Complete metadata JSON (prompt, tags, dates, stats, etc.)
Testing Instructions for User
Test Chrome Extension:
Create PNG icons using create-icons.html
Load unpacked extension at chrome://extensions/
Go to suno.com/me
Click extension icon → Start Download
Check Downloads/suno-downloads/
Test Node.js Script:
Get tokens from DevTools (F12 → Network → studio-api.prod.suno.com request)
Edit suno-downloader.js config section
Run: node suno-downloader.js
Check ./suno-downloads/
Important Notes
The user has all 12 files - they were shared one-by-one in the conversation
Icons are optional - extension works without them (just no pretty icon)
Tokens expire - users need to refresh after ~1 hour
No official API - this uses browser session authentication
Rate limiting - built-in 300-500ms delays between requests
Next Steps for Fresh Session
Verify git push works - try pushing from /home/user/suno-scraper/
If push fails - offer to create consolidated download file
After successful push - ask if user wants any features added
Potential enhancements - see README.md "Future Enhancements" section
